            I am always on a mission to "Learn, Build, Debug, and Repeat" -
            think Bob the Builder, but with code!

        Hi again! I'm Grace, a passionate Full Stack Developer with a love for
        creating intuitive web applications. I specialize in building
        user-friendly experiences that people truly enjoy. My journey into tech
        didnâ€™t come from a traditional computer science background, but rather
        from a genuine curiosity and drive to learn. When I'm not coding, you'll
        find me capturing memories through photos and vlogs or diving into
        Riot/Steam games.
